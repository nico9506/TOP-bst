TOP Project: Binary Search Trees

This is a JavaScript-based binary search tree data structure implementation. Includes the methods listed below:

insert(value): Adds a new node with the specified value to the tree.
remove(value): Deletes the node with the specified value from the tree.
find(value): Retrieves the node with the specified value from the tree.
levelOrder(): Traverses the tree in level order, visiting each node.
inorder(): Traverses the tree in an `inorder` manner, visiting each node.
preorder(): Traverses the tree in a `preorder` manner, visiting each node.
postorder(): Traverses the tree in a `postorder` manner, visiting each node.
height(): Returns the height of a node, which is defined as the longest path from the node to a leaf node.
depth(): Returns the depth of a node, which is defined as the distance from the node to the root.
isBalanced(): Checks if the tree is balanced and returns true or false accordingly.
rebalance(): Adjusts the tree to ensure it is balanced.
prettyPrint: Displays the tree in the console in a format that is easy for humans to read.
